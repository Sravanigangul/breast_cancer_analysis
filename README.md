This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of breast cancer statistics. Here are some key takeaways:
Patient Demographics: The majority of the patients are female, reflecting the prevalence of breast cancer in women.
The KM plot would provide insights into the survival rates of patients post-diagnosis, which is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of treatments and the progression of the disease.
Estrogen Receptor Positive Trends: tracked the trend of estrogen receptor-positive diagnoses over time, providing valuable insights into this subtype of breast cancer.
Median Age at Diagnosis: data shows the median age at diagnosis for both male and female patients.
Breast Cancer Types: The dashboard breaks down the different types of breast cancer diagnosed, including IDC, ILC, DCIS, and others.
Tumor Laterality: analyzed the occurrence of tumors in the left, right, or both breasts (bilateral).
Age at Diagnosis: The histogram shows the distribution of age at diagnosis.
Menopausal Status: Weâ€™ve also categorized our patients based on their menopausal status.
This data-driven approach helps us better understand the distribution and characteristics of breast cancer across different demographics and variables.
